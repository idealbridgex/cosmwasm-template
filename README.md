# CosmosWasm Contract Template

This repository serves as a template for CosmosWasm smart contracts. It provides a basic structure and functionality that can be used as a skeleton project for developing other contracts.

## Contract Overview

The contract implemented in this template includes a simple counter state. It features an "update" function that allows you to increase the counter value and a "get counter" query to retrieve the current counter value.

## Getting Started

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- [Cosmwasm](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/)

### Build

```bash
cargo wasm
```
